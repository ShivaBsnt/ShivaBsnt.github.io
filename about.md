### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Shiva Bahadur Basnet

Welcome to my personal space on the internet! I'm a passionate software developer with a strong interest in backend development, data engineering, and problem-solving using technology. I love building systems that are clean, scalable, and actually useful.

Currently, I'm focused on Python, Django, and Django REST Framework, and have over 3.5 years of industry experience building and maintaining scalable APIs and data-driven applications. My journey started with curiosity â€” experimenting with games, breaking things on my computer (then fixing them), and writing code that slowly started making sense.
