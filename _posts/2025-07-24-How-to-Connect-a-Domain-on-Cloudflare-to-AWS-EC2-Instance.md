## ✅ Requirements
- AWS EC2 instance
- A registered domain name
- A Cloudflare account

## 🔧 Step 1: Add Your Domain to Cloudflare
1. Log in to https://dash.cloudflare.com

2. Click “Add a Site”

3. Enter your domain (e.g., example.com)

4. Select the Free plan

5. Let Cloudflare scan existing DNS records

6. Proceed to the next step (you'll add your EC2 IP next)

## 🌐 Step 2: Point DNS to Your EC2 IP
1. Go to the DNS tab inside your Cloudflare dashboard

2. Add the following A records:

```
Type: A
Name: @
IPv4 Address: <your EC2 public IP>
Proxy: ON (orange cloud) or OFF if needed
```

Optional (for www):

```
Type: A
Name: www
IPv4 Address: <same EC2 IP>
Proxy: ON
```

3. Click Save

## 🛰️ Step 3: Set Cloudflare as Primary & Secondary DNS in Your Domain Provider
Cloudflare gives you two nameservers, for example:
```
clark.ns.cloudflare.com   ← Primary
emma.ns.cloudflare.com    ← Secondary
```
You must copy these and go to your domain registrar (like Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.):

📌 Example: On register.com.np
1. Visit: https://register.com.np

2. Log in with your account

3. Go to the “Domain List”

4. Click your domain name (e.g., yourname.com.np)

5. Scroll to the section called Nameservers

6. Replace existing nameservers with:
```
Primary Nameserver: clark.ns.cloudflare.com
Secondary Nameserver: emma.ns.cloudflare.com
```
7. Click ✅ Update Nameservers

(**Note: ⏳ It may take a few minutes to hours for DNS to propagate.**)

**⚠️ Notes for .np Domains**
- DNS changes may take longer to apply (~1–24 hrs)

- Ensure your domain is already approved and active in the .np system

- You can check your nameserver status using:
  ```
  dig NS yourdomain.com.np +short
  ```

## Step4: Enable Free SSL (HTTPS) on Cloudflare
Once DNS is active and orange cloud is on (proxy enabled), you can enable SSL:

 🔐 Steps:
1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard → SSL/TLS tab

2. Set SSL Mode to:

- Flexible → if your EC2 has no SSL certificate

- Full or Full (Strict) → if your EC2 has a valid certificate

3. Enable:

- ✅ Always Use HTTPS

- ✅ Auto HTTPS Rewrites

Cloudflare now handles HTTPS for your domain — even if your EC2 isn’t configured for SSL.

✅ Final Test
Check site:
```
curl -I https://yourdomain.com.np
```
